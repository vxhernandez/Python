This project focuses on the analysis of the largest companies in the world by consolidated revenue, based on data from the 2024 Fortune Global 500 rankings and other reliable sources. The dataset comprises the top 50 companies, each generating annual revenues exceeding $130 billion. Notably, Walmart, the American retail giant, has maintained its position as the world's largest company by revenue since 2014.

The list provides insights into global corporate dominance, with representation from 23 American companies, 17 Asian companies, and 10 European companies. However, it's worth noting that the list is not exhaustive, as not all companies publicly disclose their financial information.
